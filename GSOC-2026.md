# Google Summer of Code 2026 — Project Ideas

## Scheduled Compliance Scans and History

### Summary
Extend syshardn with scheduled scan execution, persistent scan history storage, and artifact export. Integrate with OS schedulers (cron, systemd timers, Task Scheduler) and store results in a local database.

### Why this matters
syshardn is currently suited to one-off checks. In real environments, teams typically need:
- repeatable scheduled runs (Linux schedulers and Windows Task Scheduler)
- durable history (so results don’t vanish after the terminal closes)
- audit-friendly artifacts (files that can be attached to tickets, audits, or incident timelines)

### Scope
- **Local persistence** of scan results: store check outcomes and metadata in a local database so history is durable across runs.
- A **history view**: list past scans with summary counts, and show details of a single scan run.
- **Per-run artifact export**: save reports (JSON, HTML, Markdown, CSV) for each scan to a predictable location.
- Documentation for **scheduling** scan execution: clear guides for cron/systemd (Linux) and Task Scheduler (Windows).
- **Exit codes** suitable for scheduler integration: distinguish non-compliance vs partial errors vs tool failures.
- **Ruleset fingerprinting**: record which rules and versions were used, so you know if history differences are due to rule changes or system drift.

Keep it safe-by-default: scheduled usage is read-only (no automatic remediation).

### Proposed deliverables
- Local history storage (file-based, SQLite) with a stable versioned format.
- A history viewer capability (summary list and details for one run).
- Artifact export capability that produces:
	- machine-readable output (metadata and results)
	- human-readable reports (existing formats)
- Exit code contract distinguishing compliance vs errors vs tool failure.
- Ruleset fingerprinting (recording rules version/hash per scan).
- Documentation for running scheduled scans using OS-native schedulers.
- CI-safe tests for the new storage/history/export behavior.

## macOS Platform Support

### Summary
Add macOS support: detect macOS, run checks via a macOS executor, and ship a focused macOS rule pack with safe defaults.

### Scope
- macOS detection and executor (check/apply/rollback).
- Focused macOS rule pack: password policy, screen lock, firewall, FileVault, Gatekeeper/SIP status (apply paths reviewed).
- Clear privilege behavior: signal when admin rights are needed and fail gracefully.
- Reporting parity: existing formats work for macOS metadata/results.
- Tests: unit coverage for detection and rule selection.

### Proposed deliverables
- macOS detection and executor with check/apply/rollback support (safe paths only).
- Minimal macOS rule pack: auth/lock/firewall/FileVault/Gatekeeper-SIP checks.
- Explicit privilege-handling and user-facing errors.
- Reporting verified for macOS outputs.
- Tests for detection and rules.
- macOS usage docs (permissions, install notes).
